# Predicting profitable customers groups
In this task, I will find out which customer group is worth investing in, based on a given dataset. After a quick look at a data and feature engineering process, I will build four machine learning classifier models to predict which investment (in group 1 or group 2) will be more profitable. 

Analysis was performed and described in the jupyter notebook, using Python version 3.8.1.
